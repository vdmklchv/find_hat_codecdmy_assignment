# FIND A HAT GAME

_FIND A HAT_ is my challenge Codecademy project with very generic requirements. The idea of the game is to move user through the field avoiding falling from the edge of the board and stepping on holes. Main goal is to get to the hat and possess it. I've trained and learned organization of files, modules through it, as well as trained Classes, static methods etc.

## Technologies

- NODE v16.13.0

## Launch

The game is launched with ```node main.js``` command in console. You will need to require ```prompt-sync``` library for user input to work.

## _HAPPY PLAYING!_
